    "## number of changing keys\n",
    "\n",
    "    You are given a 0-indexed string s typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. For example, s = \"ab\" has a change of a key while s = \"bBBb\" does not have any.\n",

    "    Input: s = \"aAbBcC\"\n",

    "    Explanation: \n",
    "    From s[0] = 'a' to s[1] = 'A', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.\n",
